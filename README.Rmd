## Introduction

Package **forestindicators** is meant to assist the estimation of indicators (metrics) for forest stands, either derived from forest inventory data or forest model simulations. Most often, those indicators will estimate the provision of forest ecosystem services, but the package can be understood more generally as a platform to estimate forest metrics.

## Package installation

Package **forestindicators** can be installed from GitHub using:
```{r installation github forestindicators, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/forestindicators")
```

## Documentation and training

Two *vignettes* are included [here](https://emf-creaf.github.io/forestindicators/articles/) illustrate: (1) how to use the R package to estimate indicators; and (2) how to define new indicators.

## Volume/biomass allometric functions

Some of the indicators require the use of allometric relationships for *volume* or *biomass* estimation. Users of **forestindicators** can define their own functions for volume/biomass estimation and provide them to calls of `estimate_indicators()`. Alternatively, they can resort on additional packages and write wrapper functions. Even though it is not a strict requirement for **forestindicators**, applications of the package within Spain will be most useful if package [**IFNallometry**](https://emf-creaf.github.io/IFNallometry/index.html) is available, because it contains wrapper functions for *volume* or *biomass* estimation, which can be readily used when calculating forest indicators. Package **IFNallometry**  is also installed from GitHub using:

```{r installation github IFNallometry, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/IFNallometry")
```

## Authorship

Package **forestindicators** is developed and maintained by the [*Ecosystem Modelling Facility*](https://emf.creaf.cat) unit at [*CREAF*](https://www.creaf.cat/) (in Spain) and the *Landscape Modelling Group* at [*CTFC*](https://www.ctfc.cat/) (in Spain).
