# Indicators of forest ecosystem services

## Introduction

Package **forestindicators** is meant to assist the estimation of
indicators (metrics) for forest stands, either derived from forest
inventory data or forest model simulations. Most often, those indicators
will estimate the provision of forest ecosystem services, but the
package can be understood more generally as a platform to estimate
forest metrics.

## Package installation

Package **forestindicators** can be installed from GitHub. At present,
it requires the previous installation of package
[**IFNallometry**](https://emf-creaf.github.io/IFNallometry/index.html)
also available in GitHub only:

``` r
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/IFNallometry")
```

Once installed, you can proceed to the installation of
**forestindicators**:

``` r
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/forestindicators")
```

## Documentation and training

Two *vignettes* are included
[here](https://emf-creaf.github.io/forestindicators/articles/)
illustrate: (1) how to use the R package to estimate indicators; and (2)
how to define new indicators.

## Authorship

Package **forestindicators** is developed and maintained by the
[*Ecosystem Modelling Facility*](https://emf.creaf.cat) unit at
[*CREAF*](https://www.creaf.cat/) (in Spain) and the *Landscape
Modelling Group* at [*CTFC*](https://www.ctfc.cat/) (in Spain).
