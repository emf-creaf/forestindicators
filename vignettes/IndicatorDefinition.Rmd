## Introduction

Package **forestindicators** is meant to provide a flexible framework into which implement the estimation of multiple forest metrics. This implies a *collaborative work* leading to the progressive extension of the set of metrics included. In this vignette, you will learn how to contribute with new indicators.

## Elements in the description of indicators

All the information regarding which indicators are included in the package and their requirements can be found in the data table `indicator_definition`. For each indicator, it includes:

 + Name
 + Method of estimation
 + Interpretation
 + Output units
 + Person responsible of its implementation in the package, who is to be contacted in case of issues/doubts.
 + Variable names required for its estimation (grouped by input data frame)

Variables cited in `indicator_definition` are defined in the data table `variable_definition`, which includes for each variable its level (*plant* or *stand*), type (*numeric* or *character*), units and description.

## Indicator functions

Each indicator has a corresponding *internal function* in the package, with the same name, but starting with a dot (`.`). All indicator functions have a common set of parameters, corresponding to the four different input data frames. The functions can also require ancillary functions to calculate biomass or volumes via allometric equations. Finally, the functions can have additional parameters, which are described in data table `additional_parameters`.

## How to define new indicators?

The inclusion of new indicators involves several tasks, which may not be executed sequentially, but all of them should be completed.

### Task 0. Fork (or re-synchronize) `forestindicators`

In order to define new indicators, you need to *fork* the GitHub repository to your user. With this, you will be able to perform developments without interfering with the main repository. If this is not the first time you contribute, the forked repository will exist, but you will need to *re-synchronize* to get the latest updates since your last contribution.

### Task 1. Update of indicator, variable and additional parameter tables

#### Indicator description

The new indicator needs to be described in data table `indicator_definition`, providing at minimum:

 + Name
 + Output units
 + Person responsible of its implementation in the package, who is to be contacted in case of issues/doubts.
 + Variable names required for its estimation (see below).

Other fields (interpretation and description) are also strongly encouraged. The indicator naming should be in lower case and words separated by underscores. 

#### Variables 

Variable names should be in lower case with words separated by underscores. For each variable, it is important to identify to which input data group the required variables belongs (i.e. *stand-level* vs. *plant-level* or *static* vs. *dynamic*). Note that a given variable name can only belong to one group. If new variables need to be defined, you should modify the data table `variable_definition`, providing for each variable its type, units and description.

#### Additional parameters

Apart from the data frame inputs, some indicators will require additional parameters. These should be described in data table `additional_parameters`. Note that during the package building procedure, there is a check between parameter names in `additional_parameters` and the implementation of internal indicator functions (see below).

### Task 2. Implementation of internal indicator functions

As stated above, each indicator has a corresponding *internal function* in the package, with the same name, but starting with a dot (`.`). This function implements the estimation procedure described in the indicator definition. The general structure of the internal function will be:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
.[indicator name] <- function(stand_static_input = NULL,
                              stand_dynamic_input = NULL,
                              plant_static_input = NULL,
                              plant_dynamic_input = NULL,
                              # [additional param 1],
                              # [additional param n],
                              ...){
}
```

The three dots (i.e. `...`) are used to ignore additional parameters passed by function `estimate_indicators()`. This has the advantage of allowing the omission of data input parameters that are not to be used. As an example we show here the internal function for the estimation of basal area, which only requires one data frame, `stand_dynamic_input`, and has two additional parameters:

```{r}
forestindicators:::.basal_area
```


### Task 3. Write tests to check functionality

Along with the implementation of the indicator internal function, it is good practice to include tests in the package to ensure that the function works and has the intended behavior. Tests should be written following the guidelines of package **test_that**.

### Task 4. Checks and pull request

When the other tasks are finished, you should reload package data and be sure that the package passes formal checks. If so, you can then push changes to your GitHub repository and then make a pull request to the main repository. The package maintainers should then revise the changes and approve or not the package modifications.
